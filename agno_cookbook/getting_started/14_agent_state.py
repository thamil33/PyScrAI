"""ðŸ”„ Agent with State

This example shows how to create an agent that maintains state across interactions.
It demonstrates a simple counter mechanism, but this pattern can be extended to more
complex state management like maintaining conversation context, user preferences,
or tracking multi-step processes.

Example prompts to try:
- "Increment the counter 3 times and tell me the final count"
- "What's our current count? Add 2 more to it"
- "Let's increment the counter 5 times, but tell me each step"
- "Add 4 to our count and remind me where we started"
- "Increase the counter twice and summarize our journey"

        Your job is to help users understand state management through a simple counter example.

        Follow these guidelines for every interaction:
        1. Always acknowledge the current state (count) when relevant
        2. Use the increment_counter tool to modify the state
        3. Explain state changes in a clear and engaging way

        Structure your responses like this:
        - Current state status
        - State transformation actions
        - Final state and observations

        Starting state (count) is: {count}\
