## Completed Components:

### 1. Agent Runtime System (`pyscrai/engines/agent_runtime.py`)

- __AgentRuntime class__: Central system for managing agent lifecycle during scenario execution
- __Agent lifecycle management__: Start/stop agents with appropriate engines
- __Context sharing__: Pass scenario context between agents and maintain state
- __Engine coordination__: Connect AgentInstances to Actor/Narrator/Analyst engines
- __Scenario-level operations__: Start/stop all agents for a scenario run

### 2. Context Management (`pyscrai/engines/context_manager.py`)

- __ContextManager class__: Handles context sharing between agents and scenarios
- __Context isolation__: Separate contexts per agent and scenario
- __Context inheritance__: Agents inherit from scenario context with override capability
- __Context persistence__: Save/load context state for scenario continuity

### 3. Memory System (`pyscrai/engines/memory_system.py`)

- __AgentMemorySystem__: Individual agent memory with episodic and semantic storage
- __GlobalMemorySystem__: Shared memory across all agents in a scenario
- __Memory persistence__: SQLite-based storage for agent memories
- __Memory retrieval__: Search and filter memories by type, importance, and recency

### 4. Tool Integration (`pyscrai/engines/tool_integration.py`)

- __ToolRegistry__: Central registry for available tools and APIs
- __AgentToolManager__: Per-agent tool access and execution
- __GlobalToolIntegration__: System-wide tool coordination
- __Tool definitions__: Structured tool descriptions with parameters and validation

### 5. Integration Layer (`pyscrai/engines/integration_layer.py`)

- __AgentEngineIntegration__: Main coordinator connecting all systems
- __Unified interface__: Single point of access for agent-engine operations
- __System coordination__: Orchestrates runtime, context, memory, and tools
- __Error handling__: Comprehensive error management and recovery

### 6. Enhanced Engine Implementations

- __ActorEngine__: Role-playing and character interaction capabilities
- __NarratorEngine__: Scene description and storytelling with perspective control
- __AnalystEngine__: Data analysis and insight generation with metrics tracking
- __BaseEngine__: Foundation with proper initialization and state management

## Key Features Implemented:

✅ __Agent Runtime__: Connect AgentInstances to appropriate engines ✅ __Context Passing__: Share scenario context between agents\
✅ __Memory System__: Agent memory persistence and retrieval ✅ __Tool Integration__: Connect agents to external tools/APIs ✅ __Engine Coordination__: Unified system for managing all components ✅ __Error Handling__: Graceful failure recovery and comprehensive logging
