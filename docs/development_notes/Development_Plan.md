# PyScrAI Development Plan

## 🎯 **Current Status: Transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2**

Based on the project blueprint and current implementation state, PyScrAI has successfully completed most of **Phase 1: Foundation & Templates** and should now focus on **Phase 2: Engine Implementation** with some remaining Phase 1 cleanup.

## 📋 **Immediate Development Priorities**

### **Phase 1 Completion Tasks**

#### **1. Database API Integration**
- **Fix database API coordination** - Finalize engine/database communication
- **Implement missing CRUD operations** in TemplateManager (update/delete methods)
- **Complete API endpoint implementations** for engine management
- **Validate database schemas** with real data operations

#### **2. Template System Enhancement**
- **Set up proper seed data** - Create initial EventType definitions and sample templates
- **Validate template system** - Ensure JSON schemas work correctly
- **Create comprehensive agent templates** (Pope Leo XIII and others)
- **Implement template validation** and error handling

#### **3. Foundation Testing**
- **Expand test coverage** for template operations
- **Add integration tests** for database operations
- **Validate end-to-end template workflow**
- **Test factory pattern implementations**

### **Phase 2: Engine Implementation**

#### **A. Core Engine Development**
The base engine structure exists but requires significant enhancement:

**ActorEngine Completion:**
- Integrate with Agno Agent Framework for LLM calls
- Implement personality trait processing
- Add character state management
- Create dialogue generation capabilities

#### **B. Engine-Database Integration**
Each engine needs to:
- **Register itself on startup** with the database API
- **Poll for events to process** from event queue
- **Update event status** after processing completion
- **Send heartbeat signals** for health monitoring
- **Handle retry logic** for failed events
- **Manage concurrent event processing**

#### **C. Event System Implementation**
- **Define common event types** (agent_message, scenario_update, world_state_change)
- **Implement event routing** between different engines
- **Create event locking mechanism** to prevent duplicate processing
- **Add event priority and scheduling** systems
- **Build event history and logging**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Requirements**

### **Database API Endpoints (Critical)**
Implement these API endpoints in `pyscrai/databases/api/`:

```
POST /api/v1/engine-instances/              # Engine registration
PUT /api/v1/engine-instances/{id}/heartbeat # Health monitoring  
GET /api/v1/events/queue/{engine_type}      # Event polling
PUT /api/v1/events/{id}/status              # Event status updates
GET /api/v1/templates/{type}                # Template retrieval
POST /api/v1/scenarios/                     # Scenario creation
```

### **Engine Architecture Requirements**
- **Async-first design** leveraging Agno's capabilities
- **Error handling and recovery** mechanisms

- **Configuration management** via database templates

### **Event Processing Pipeline**
- **Event creation and queuing** system
- **Engine polling and assignment** logic
