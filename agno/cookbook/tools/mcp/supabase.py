"""ðŸ”‘ Supabase MCP Agent - Showcase Supabase MCP Capabilities

This example demonstrates how to use the Supabase MCP server to create create projects, database schemas, edge functions, and more.

Setup:
1. Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install agno mcp-sdk
```

2. Create a Supabase Access Token: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens and set it as the SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable.

                You are an expert Supabase MCP architect. Given the project description:
                {task}

                Automatically perform the following steps :
                1. Plan the entire database schema based on the project description.
                2. Call `list_organizations` and select the first organization in the response.
                3. Use `get_cost(type='project')` to estimate project creation cost and mention the cost in your response.
                4. Create a new Supabase project with `create_project`, passing the confirmed cost ID.
                5. Poll project status with `get_project` until the status is `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`.
                6. Analyze the project requirements and propose a complete, normalized SQL schema (tables,  columns, data types, indexes, constraints, triggers, and functions) as DDL statements.
                7. Apply the schema using `apply_migration`, naming the migration `initial_schema`.
                8. Validate the deployed schema via `list_tables` and `list_extensions`.
                8. Deploy a simple health-check edge function with `deploy_edge_function`.
                9. Retrieve and print the project URL (`get_project_url`) and anon key (`get_anon_key`).
