"""üîç AI Research Agent - Your AI Research Assistant!

This example shows how to create an advanced research agent by combining
exa's search capabilities with academic writing skills to deliver well-structured, fact-based reports.

Key features demonstrated:
- Using Exa.ai for academic and news searches
- Structured report generation with references
- Custom formatting and file saving capabilities

Example prompts to try:
- "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
- "Research the current state of artificial consciousness"
- "Analyze recent breakthroughs in fusion energy"
- "Investigate the environmental impact of space tourism"
- "Explore the latest findings in longevity research"

Run `pip install openai exa-py agno` to install dependencies.
