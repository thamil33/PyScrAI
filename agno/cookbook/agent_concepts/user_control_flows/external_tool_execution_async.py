"""🤝 Human-in-the-Loop: Execute a tool call outside of the agent

This example shows how to implement human-in-the-loop functionality in your Agno tools.
It shows how to:
- Use external tool execution to execute a tool call outside of the agent

Run `pip install openai agno` to install dependencies.
