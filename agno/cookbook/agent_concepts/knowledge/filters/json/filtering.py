"""
User-Level Knowledge Filtering Example

This cookbook demonstrates how to use knowledge filters to restrict knowledge base searches to specific users, document types, or any other metadata attributes.

Key concepts demonstrated:
1. Loading documents with user-specific metadata
2. Filtering knowledge base searches by user ID
3. Combining multiple filter criteria
4. Comparing results across different filter combinations

You can pass filters in the following ways:
1. If you pass on Agent only, we use that for all runs
2. If you pass on run/print_response only, we use that for that run
3. If you pass on both, we override with the filters passed on run/print_response for that run
